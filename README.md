Authors: Jialu Wang, Zedong Peng, Ryan Hughes, Debangsu Bhattacharyya, David E. Bernal Neira, Alexander W. Dowling 

This repository contains code and results for paper: Measure this, not that: Optimizing the cost and model-based information content of measurements 

## Installation instructions 

The following instructions assume you have anaconda installed. We suggest create an environment with the following commands to run code: 

### Step 1: create a new environment 
- create new environment, called for e.g. `measurement_optimization`, with `conda` with `Python` version 3.8

`conda create --name measurement_optimization python=3.8`

`conda activate measurement_optimization`
   
### Step 2 (optional): install `IDAES-PSE`
- this step provides `Ipopt` solver, but this solver is not necessary for reproducing paper results if you already have `Ipopt`. If step 2 is conducted, step 3 can be skipped

`pip install idaes-pse` 

`idaes get-extensions`

### Step 3: install `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` 
- If not installing `IDAES-PSE`, the following packages are needed: 
  
`conda install numpy`

`conda install scipy`

`conda install pandas`

`conda install matplotlib`
   
### Step 4: install `Pyomo` from specified branches
- install from the following branch for a generalization version of Mindtpy:

`pip install git+https://github.com/ZedongPeng/pyomo.git@add_mindtpy_callback`

   
### Step 5: install `GurobiPy`
- this is needed only for solving mixed-integer problems

  `conda install -c gurobi gurobi`

  (By Feb. 25 2024) ND CRC users: CRC hasn't updated their gurobi license to version 11. If you install gurobi without specifying version 10, it will pop an error about not having license for version 11. To specify a version for CRC:

  `conda install -c gurobi gurobi==10.0.3`
   
### Step 6: install `CyIpopt`
- this is needed only for D-optimality problems with grey-box modules

   `conda install -c conda-forge cyipopt`

### Step 7: install `jupyter notebook`
- this is needed only for the draw_figure.ipynb notebook

  `conda install jupyter notebook`

### Software versions we use for the results 

`Python`: 3.8

`IDAES-PSE`: 2.2.0

`Pyomo`: 6.7.0 dev 0

`GurobiPy`: 10.0.3

`CyIpopt`: 1.3.0

## Example to run code and reproduce figures for case studies

Setup the scripts to reproduce result files and figures from the paper: 

### Kinetics case study 

- Step 1: run `kinetics_MO.py`
- Step 2: with `mip_option` and `objective`, choose to run the A-optimality or D-optimality, mixed-integer or relaxed problem 
- Step 3: with `rerun_all_paper_results`, set up the budget ranges as you want to try. 

  If `rerun_all_paper_results`: we use the budget range [1000, 5000] with a 400 discretization,
  i.e. [1000, 1400, 1800, ..., 5000] for mixed-integer problems.

  Otherwise, we use three budget [1000, 2200, 3800] to do a test run.
  
- Step 4: with `linear_solver_opt`, choose the linear solver for `CyIpopt`. If not specified, it will use the default linear solver, which is `ma27` if you have HSL, otherwise `mumps`. 

- Step 5: with `initializer_option` and `curr_results`, select initial solutions to initialize the problem, and provide file paths for these solutions

  You can choose from: A- and D-optimality, with mixed-integer or continuous options. In the paper, both objective functions and both mixed-integer and continuous frameworks are considered and solved. Refer to Eq. (11) in section 2.3 for the MO problem with mixed-integer and continuous options, Eq. (12), (13) in section 2.4 for A- and D-optimality. 
  
- Step 6: store results for drawing figures

  To do this, define the param `file_store_name` with a string you given, for e.g., "MINLP_result_".

  Then both the solutions and the FIM of the results are stored separately.

  For e.g., if running in the range [1000, 5000], the stored files will be:

  MINLP_result_1000, MINLP_result_fim_1000,

  ...

  MINLP_result_5000, MINLP_result_fim_5000,
  
- Step 7: use draw_figure.ipynb to read stored FIM and solutions

  - `read_fim` receives the string name, for.e.g. `MINLP_result_`, and budget ranges, returns a list of A- and D-optimality values of the given FIMs
 
  - `plot_data` receives both the A- and D-optimality of all four optimization strategies, and draw two figures like Fig. 3 in paper
 
  - `read_solution` receives the string name, for e.g. `MINLP_result_`, and budget ranges, returns 6 lists: CA, CB, CC solutions as SCM and DCM,
    each list contains four lists as results from four strategies
 
  - `plot_one_solution` receives and draws the solution of one measurement under four strategies. To reproduce result figure like Fig. S-2 in paper, call it 6 times to draw all 6 figures and combine to a panel figure. 

  

### Rotary bed case study 

- Step 1: run `rotary_bed_MO.py`
- Step 2: with `mip_option` and `objective`, choose to run the A-optimality or D-optimality, mixed-integer or relaxed problem 
- Step 3: with `rerun_all_paper_results`, set up the budget ranges as you want to try. 

  If `rerun_all_paper_results`: In our results, we use the budget range [1000, 25000] with a 1000 discretization,
  i.e. [1000, 11000, ..., 25000], for relaxed problems

  Otherwise, we use three budget [1000, 5000, 10000] to do a test run.

- Step 4: with `linear_solver_opt`, choose the linear solver for `CyIpopt`. If not specified, it will use the default linear solver, which is `ma27` if you have HSL, otherwise `mumps`.
  
- Step 5: with `initializer_option` and `curr_results`, select initial solutions to initialize the problem, and provide file paths for these solutions

  You can choose from: A- and D-optimality, with mixed-integer or continuous options. 
  
- Step 6: store results for drawing figures

  To do this, define the param `file_store_name` with a string you given, for e.g., "MINLP_result_".

  Then both the solutions and the FIM of the results are stored separately.

  For e.g., if running in the range [1000, 25000], the stored files will be:

  MINLP_result_1000, MINLP_result_fim_1000,

  ...

  MINLP_result_25000, MINLP_result_fim_25000,
  
- Step 7: use draw_figure.ipynb to read stored FIM and solutions

  - `read_fim` receives the string name, for.e.g. `MINLP_result_`, and budget ranges, returns a list of A- and D-optimality values of the given FIMs
 
  - `plot_data` receives both the A- and D-optimality of all four optimization strategies, and draw two figures like Fig. 6 in paper

## Result files
